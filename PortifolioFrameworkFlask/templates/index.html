        <p>Assessment:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Live Coding Test (We will receive the exam 48 hours in advance) - (12/11 and 12/18) (date changed later)</li>
            <li>Portfolio Submission (02/12)</li>
            <li>Practical Application with Requirements (01/22)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The last activity must include:</p>

            <li>Clean code;</li>
            <li>Fully functional;</li>
            <li>Necessary validations for data input, errors, etc.;</li>
            <li>Bonus: If the application is elastic or scalable;</li>
            <li>Integration with a database;</li>
            <li>Tests will be conducted based on our project documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes for the next class:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a Python virtual environment using venv;</li>
            <li>Know how to install Python packages (we will install packages for use in class);</li>
            <li>Requirements file: A dependency file to replicate the virtual environment. It is a TXT file listing the dependencies we use + their versions (similar to package.json);</li>

        <p>Best Practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never place code inside the virtual environment folder;</li>
            <li>Applications should be web-based, not local.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CLASS 03 (10/23)</h4><div class="decorative-line"></div><h2>Creating A Virtual Environment In Python On Windows</h2>
        <p>Step-by-step:</p>
        <p>Creating the environment inside the VSCode terminal: <code>python -m venv environment_name </code></p>
        <p>Allow virtual environments in PowerShell (only needed once): <br>
            <code>Get-ExecutionPolicy</code>  <br>
            <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser</code>  
        </p>
        <p>Activating the environment: <code>environment_name\Scripts\activate</code></p>
        <p>Accessing venv after creation:</p>
        <p>Navigating to the project folder: </p>
        <code>cd D:\User Documents\Documents\GitHub\FrameworksDesenvolvimentoWeb\projeto01</code>
        <p>Activating: <code>environment1.venv\Scripts\activate</code></p>
        <p>Deactivating: <code>Deactivate</code></p>
        <p>Installing dependencies: <code>pip install package_name</code></p>
        <p>Listing all installed packages: <code>pip list</code></p>
        <p><b>Packages installed in the first lesson:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>flask</li>
            <li>flask sqlalchemy</li>
            <li>numpy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note: </b>NumPy is used for manipulating arrays, matrices, etc., and is faster than loops.</p>
        <p><b>PyPI: </b>a website that allows searching for packages and provides installation instructions.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT: </b>Always install and run libraries inside the virtual environment.</p>
        <p>Used progress bar and time functions.</p>
        <p>Classes will begin with a list of activities, then concepts that we will use to carry out these activities.</p>
        <p><b>File Standards and Code Organization: </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frameworks follow specific standards.</li>
            <li>.html files must be inside the templates folder.</li>
            <li>CLEAN CODE and RELEVANT NAMES! NO COMMENTS.</li>
            <li>ALL NAMES IN ENGLISH‚Äîno Portuguese for classes, variables, filenames, or files.</li>
            <li>Use snake_case for variable names (Python convention), with no accents or special characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>‚ú® In this class we create the folders: templates, static and adjacent folders. Also, the app.py file - app.py is the main file we will use;</p>
        <br>

        <h4>CLASS 04 (10/30)</h4><div class="decorative-line"></div><h2>Creating A New Virtual Environment And Developing Code</h2>
        <p>Always import Flask when creating a new virtual environment: <code>from flask import Flask</code></p>
        <p><b>Key Concepts:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every web request works with RR (Request and Response).</li>
            <li>The web environment operates reactively‚Äîit only acts when a request is made.</li>
            <li>Flask allows the Python code to listen for incoming requests and respond accordingly.</li>
            <li>First, the request reaches Flask, then, Python processes the request and returns a response.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first step is to create the Flask application.</p>
        <p>The application variable can have any name, but it is commonly named app.py</p>
        <p>To automatically updates the server on code changes: <code>app.run(debug=True)</code></p>
        <p>To change the default port: <code>app.run(debug=True, port=XXXX)</code></p>
        <p>To make the application available to everyone on the same network: <code>app.run(debug=True, port=XXXX, host='0.0.0.0')</code></p>
        <p>For a web application to be reactive, it needs routes. Routes must be linked to a function that defines the response.</p>
        <p>This is how to create different web pages: </p>
        <code>
            @app.route('/contact')<br>
            def contact():<br>
            return 'This is the user page'<br>             
        </code>
        
        <p>‚ú® What was done in this lesson: Created a new app.py, created multiple pages for the application, learned how to use HTML inside Python with Flask.</p>

        <h3>üíª Activities</h3>

        {% for activity in list01 %}

            <a href="{{ activity.url }}" target="_blank">{{ activity.name }}</a><br>

        {% endfor %}

        <p>üìù All these projects should be part of a single Flask project.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>CLASS 05 (11/06)</h4><div class="decorative-line"></div><h2>Passing Parameters In Flask</h2>
        <p>Passing Parameters from Flask to an HTML Template: <code>render_template('index.html', name=name)</code></p>

        <p>‚ú® What was done in this lesson: we had time in class to work on the activities, experimented with connecting our code to another student‚Äôs project.
            
        <h3>üíª Activities</h3>

        {% for activity in list02 %}

            <a href="{{ activity.url }}" target="_blank">{{ activity.name }}</a><br>
    
        {% endfor %}

        <h4>CLASS 06 (11/13)</h4><div class="decorative-line"></div><h2>Basic Rules For Development</h2>
        <p>1st Do not trust the data coming from the request</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validate all data; this validation depends on what is expected for each data type (e.g., text, number, etc.);</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2nd Ensure data integrity and consistency</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that what you received will be useful to calculate what is needed</li>
            <li>Store it so it can be recovered if necessary;</li>
            <li>We use persistent storage to preserve this data because persistence ensures durability and reliability;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3rd Work either asynchronously or synchronously</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If synchronous, you must return the response in a timely manner;</li>
            <li>In web development, synchronous methods are usually used;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4th Handle exceptions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not let the backend crash;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>NOTE: </b>In Python, we validate things through selection structures (what we know as conditional structures, but we cannot call them conditionals because these structures are used for selection purposes).</p>
        <p>Validate the data, handle exceptions, and then persist it in database systems.</p>
        <p>We will use SQLite</p>
        <p>If nothing is specified in the URL bar, it defaults to GET</p>
